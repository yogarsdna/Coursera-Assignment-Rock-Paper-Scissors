# Coursera Assignment - Rock Paper Scissors

This is one of the Coursera assignments provided in the Browser-based Models with TensorFlow.js course in the week 4 section where it discusses Transfer Learning with Pre-Trained Models. This assignment is about training our model in the browser using our webcam. We will train our model in exactly the same way as in the Rock, Paper, Scissors example but now we will include the Lizard and Spock hand gestures.
